- Created the Front-End infrastructure using React and Next.js technologies.
- Implemented responsive transitions with Tailwind CSS.

- Handled form controls and data validation with Formik and Yup.
- Utilized MongoDB for database operations.

In addition to the core features taught by the course instructors, I added some extra features to enrich the project:

- Enhanced state management with Redux-Toolkit to optimize data flow between different components.
